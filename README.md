# 🎓 Students Performance Report - SQL Project

This project demonstrates how to perform **data analysis and reporting** using **SQL queries** on a **student performance dataset**.  
The goal is to extract actionable insights related to student scores, demographics, and academic performance trends.

## 📚 Project Overview

The project involves:

- Importing a student performance dataset into a SQL database
- Performing data cleaning and preparation
- Writing analytical SQL queries to generate meaningful reports
- Identifying patterns and factors affecting student performance

## 🛠 Tools and Technologies Used

- **MySQL** (SQL RDBMS)
- **SQL Queries** (SELECT, GROUP BY, JOIN, CTEs, Aggregations)
- **Excel/CSV** (for dataset input)

## 📈 Key Analysis Areas

- 📊 Average scores by gender, race/ethnicity, and parental education level
- 🧠 Subject-wise performance (Math, Reading, Writing)
- 📈 Trends in scores based on test preparation course completion
- 🎯 Top-performing and underperforming students
- 📚 Correlation between parental education and student achievements
